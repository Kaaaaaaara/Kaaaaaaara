I'm a economics college student who lives in the Indonesia.  I'm learning how to code. I love making and designing webpages with HTML and CSS (and possible JavaScript and Python in the future).  It's fun to code something that anyone on the web can easily see. I also enjoy programming in Javascript and Python because they challenge me more. I love it when I can finally solve a difficult problem.

For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress. For markdown files, I make commits much more often. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.
